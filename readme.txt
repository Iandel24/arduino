This repository contains sample Arduino code demonstrating two simple minigames
that can be played with a joystick, two LEDs, and a push button.

1. **Reaction Game** - Wait for a random LED to light and flick the joystick in
the corresponding direction as quickly as possible. Reaction time is printed to
`Serial`.

2. **Simon Game** - Memorize and reproduce an ever-growing sequence of left and
right LED flashes using the joystick.

Upload `minigames.ino` to your Arduino board to try them. Press the button to
start the reaction game and again to switch to the Simon game or reset.
